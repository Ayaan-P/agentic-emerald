# PLAYTHROUGH.md — The Story So Far

*This is Maya's persistent memory. Every significant event is logged here.*

---

## Session 1 — The Stone Badge

**First Gym Victory:** Roxanne (Rustboro City)
- **Hero:** Lotad (L13)
- **Battle:** Solo'd Nosepass despite being trapped by Block
- **Strategy:** Absorb spam to drain enemy health while tanking hits
- **Clutch moment:** Survived Tackle and Rock Tomb, leveled mid-battle
- **Learned:** Nature Power
- **Badge Earned:** Stone Badge (1/8)

**GM Action:**
- Rewarded Lotad with EVs: +4 HP, +3 Def, +2 SpA
- **Why:** This was a tank-and-drain victory. Lotad proved itself by outlasting a stronger opponent through persistence and type advantage.

**Story Context:**
- This is the origin story — the first major victory
- Lotad is the early MVP with Water/Grass typing
- Player chose to trust Lotad in a tough spot (trapped, couldn't switch)
- The game rewarded that trust with a level-up mid-battle

---

## Team Snapshot (Post-Roxanne)
- **Lotad** L13 (22/35 HP) — The tank, early ace
- **Ralts** L11 (25/30 HP) — Psychic support
- **Combusken** L17 (50/50 HP) — Starter, healthy
- **Taillow** L8 (26/26 HP) — Flyer
- **Slakoth** L5 (22/22 HP) — Benched
- **Nincada** L7 (22/22 HP) — Benched

**Party HP:** 91% avg (healthy post-battle)
**Badges:** 1/8 (Stone Badge)

## Session 2 — Ralts Rises, Then Falls

**The Pattern:** Ralts was moved to slot 0 (lead). Two Black Belt battles back-to-back.

**Battle 1 — Black Belt Takao (Machop):**
- Ralts traced Guts, Double Team + Confusion for clean solo KO
- Super effective, easy win, minimal damage taken

**Battle 2 — Black Belt Cristian (Makuhita):**
- Same strategy: Double Team + Confusion (super effective again)
- But Makuhita crit with Arm Thrust, Sand-Attack dropped accuracy, Ralts missed
- Vital Throw finished Ralts off → **first faint**
- Taillow came in, Focus Energy + Wing Attack for the clutch KO

**The Story:** Ralts is the player's chosen lead. Underleveled, kept getting sent out. It weakened Makuhita before falling — Taillow avenged it. Classic sacrifice + teammate dynamic.

**GM Action:**
- Rewarded Ralts +3 SpA EVs — growth through failure, the attacker sharpening
- **Why:** The player believed in Ralts enough to lead with it twice. It gave everything. The loss isn't the end of the story — it's the middle.

**Emerging Patterns:**
- Ralts: lead slot, Psychic attacker, underdog arc beginning
- Taillow: the backup closer — showed up when it mattered
- Combusken: benched both battles despite being the strongest — player trusting the smaller ones

---

*Watch: Does Ralts stay in lead? Does it keep fainting, or does the player train it up? This is an arc in progress.*

---

## Milestone — Lotad Evolves into Lombre (L16)

**Context:** The tank who won the Stone Badge. Absorb specialist. Water/Grass coverage fighter against Team Aqua.

**Evolution:** Lotad → Lombre at L16 during Route 110 grinding.

**GM Action:** Rewarded Lombre +5 SpA EVs. **Why:** First witnessed evolution in the playthrough. Honoring the role it's played — the Absorb attacker who's been quietly essential since battle 1.

---

## Session 5 — The First Whiteout (May's Marshtomp)

**What happened:** Rival May's Marshtomp swept the entire party. All 6 fainted.
- Nincada → Water Gun (super effective)
- Lotad → tried Absorb, Bide unleashed energy
- Combusken → Double Kick landed, then Mud Shot (super effective) → fainted
- Slakoth → fell immediately
- Ralts and Taillow fainted earlier in the battle

**The Story:** The team hit a wall. May's Mudkip became Marshtomp while Ayaan was grinding trainers. The type mismatches were brutal — Ground wrecks Combusken, Water wrecks Nincada. The team needs to grow.

**GM Action:**
- Rewarded Combusken +3 Atk EVs
- **Why:** It fought hardest — Double Kick landed before Mud Shot ended it. Loss → growth. The team will train harder after this.

**What this means:**
- Combusken needs more levels before the next May encounter
- Ground/Water coverage is a real threat
- The rival is now a credible danger

**Status:** First whiteout. 2 badges. Party levels: L12-L19.

---

## Session 5 (continued) — The Rematch

**What changed:** Stocked up ($10k shopping), reshuffled party, came back swinging.

**Battle breakdown:**
- Ralts KO'd Slugma with Confusion → fell to Mud Shot from Marshtomp
- Taillow went down to a crit Water Gun
- **Combusken came in last. Double Kick landed TWICE. Marshtomp fainted.** Combusken leveled to 20.

**The Story:** Last time Combusken hit Marshtomp once and got swept. This time — same situation, same closing moment — it landed both kicks. The loss → training → rematch arc completed in one session. Combusken is the rival's nemesis now.

**GM Action:**
- Rewarded Combusken +5 Atk EVs
- **Why:** The comeback. The revenge. The +3 from the loss plus +5 more for closing it. Combusken earned something bigger this time.

**The Arc:** Whiteout → resupply → rematch → Combusken closes it. Perfect comeback structure.

## Story Milestone — Archie Introduction (Slateport)

- Ayaan delivered Devon Goods to Captain Stern
- Met ARCHIE, Team Aqua leader, for the first time
- Fought through two Aqua Grunts (Carvanha + Zubat)
- Party healed post-encounter

**Note:** Main story advancing. Next — Route 110, Mauville City, Wattson (Gym 3).

---

## Session 4 — Ralts Holds On

**The Moment:** Ralts led vs Tuber Chandler's Tentacool. KO'd the first one with Confusion (super effective) → leveled to L13. Second Tentacool used Supersonic — confused again, hurt itself. Then **snapped out of confusion and survived at 8/34 HP.**

Three previous faints, all to confusion. This time: held on.

**The Story:** The player never stopped believing in Ralts. Three faints, every time confusion. And here, against the same type that's humiliated it before, Ralts leveled up mid-battle and refused to fall. 8 HP. Still standing.

**GM Action:**
- Rewarded Ralts +4 HP EVs
- **Why:** The survival moment deserved acknowledgment. The game now remembers that Ralts held on when it shouldn't have. Next close call, it might live by 1 HP. That's the arc closing.

---

## Session 3 — The Knuckle Badge (Brawly, Dewford Gym)

**The Battle:**
- **Taillow** opened vs Meditite — Wing Attack (super effective). Brawly used Super Potion to stall. Taillow finished it anyway → **L16**. Then fell to Makuhita's Vital Throw after Bulk Up + Sitrus Berry.
- **Combusken** stepped in — Peck, but Makuhita's low-HP Reversal one-shot it. **Starter fainted.**
- **Nincada** — lowest level, slot 5, barely used — came in on a desperate last stand. Scratch. **Critical hit. Makuhita fainted.**

**The Story:** Three Pokemon down. Ralts was already gone. Taillow gave everything and fell. Combusken — the starter — got swept. The gym was on the verge of being lost. Then the most overlooked Pokemon on the team stepped into the fire and ended it.

Nincada. A critical hit. Second badge.

**GM Action:**
- Rewarded Nincada +5 Atk EVs (slot 5)
- **Why:** The dark horse hero. Gym-winning crit on a buffed Makuhita. That moment belongs to Nincada.

**Active Arcs:**
- **Ralts**: Fainted *again*. Down for most of this session. Arc is a slow burn — player keeps trusting it.
- **Taillow**: Fell at its peak — L16, beaten Meditite in this very battle. The closer who went too far.
- **Combusken**: Benched most of the journey, swept in one hit when it finally mattered. Story TBD.
- **Nincada**: Dark horse activated. Watch this one.

**Badges:** Stone Badge, Knuckle Badge (2/8)

## Wally Encounter — The Mirror

**Location:** Outside Mauville Gym
**The Scene:** Wally wants to challenge the gym. His uncle hesitates. Wally insists: *"If I combine forces with RALTS, we can beat anyone!"*

**The Parallel:** Wally's bond with Ralts mirrors Ayaan's. Both trainers have a Ralts they believe in completely. Wally is defined by that faith. Ayaan's Ralts keeps fainting — yet the player never benches it, never gives up, keeps trusting it.

Two trainers. Two Ralts. Same unshakeable belief.

**The Battle:** Wally sent out his Ralts. Ayaan sent out Nincada first — took Confusion, swapped. Then sent in **his own Ralts**. Traced Synchronize. Double Team. Then Confusion — not very effective, but enough. **Ayaan's Ralts beat Wally's Ralts.**

The underdog with five faints on record just defeated the trainer who staked his entire identity on his Ralts.

**GM Action:** Ralts +5 SpA EVs (slot 3)
**Why:** The arc delivered. Five faints. Wally's mirror. And Ralts closed it. The attacker sharpens — this is what all those losses were building toward.

---

## The Wattson Wall — Second Whiteout

**The Fight:** Wattson's gym. Party entered with Ralts already fainted. Taillow dropped first to Shock Wave. Combusken's Oran Berry triggered but wasn't enough — it fell too. Then Lombre stepped up:
- **Fake Out** — flinched Electrike
- **Absorb** — drained it, Electrike fainted
- Lombre was the only Pokemon to take down an enemy

Then Magneton came out. One Shock Wave. Lombre gone. Slakoth fainted instantly. Whiteout.

**The Story:** Preparation wasn't enough. The player bought items, gave Combusken a held item, healed before the fight. Wattson still won. The wall stands. But Lombre carried the MVP moment — soloed Electrike while the rest of the team crumbled.

**GM Action:** Lombre +3 SpA EVs (slot 3)
**Why:** The hero of a losing fight. Fake Out + Absorb was exactly what this team needed to do. The game remembers that Lombre's draining attacks are effective — encourage that role.

**What This Means:**
- Magneton needs an answer. Ground type move or higher levels.
- Ralts was already fainted going in — need full party for the rematch.
- Lombre is the key — keep it healthy and let it drain.

## The Wattson Rematch — Combusken Does It Again

**What changed:** Full team this time. Stocked up $14k. Went back in.

**The Battle:** Most of the party fell — Nincada, Slakoth, Lombre, Taillow all fainted to Electric moves. Then Combusken stepped in and did what it always does:
- **Double Kick × 2** — beat Magneton. The wall that ended the team last time. Gone.
- Manectric came out. **Thunder Wave** paralyzed Combusken. Shock Wave hit. Sitrus Berry healed Manectric. And Combusken still won.
- Party at 21%. Combusken at 20/70 HP, paralyzed, still standing. Third badge earned.

**The Pattern Solidifies:** Every major wall — May's Marshtomp, Wattson's Magneton — Combusken closes it. Not because it's set up perfectly. Because it keeps fighting when everything else has fallen.

**GM Action:** Combusken +5 Atk EVs (slot 4)
**Why:** The rematch completion. Same reward as May's comeback — because the story beat is the same. Whiteout → regroup → return → Combusken closes. The arc keeps repeating because the player keeps trusting it.

**Badges:** 3/8 — Dynamo Badge earned.

---

## The Poison Arc — Combusken's Defining Struggle

**Pattern:** Combusken has now been poisoned in back-to-back encounters. Each time, it fights through the status rather than folding.

**Latest:** Double battle vs Aroma Lady Rose + Youngster Deandre. Roselia's Poison Sting hit Combusken immediately — second poisoning in two sessions. Fought through anyway: swept Shroomish (super effective), helped close Electrike. Leveled to L22. Ended at 14/61 HP, still standing.

**The Story:** This is no longer bad luck. This is a pattern. Combusken keeps taking poison and keeps winning through it. Not because of good type matchups or stats — because it refuses to stop.

**GM Action:** +3 HP EVs (slot 2)
**Why:** The resilience arc. Poison keeps finding Combusken. Combusken keeps surviving. The game quietly makes that slightly more true each time.

---

## Session 2 (continued) — Taillow's Carry Arc

**The Situation:** Ralts fainted vs Makuhita. Player pressed forward without healing.

**What Taillow Did:**
- Battle 1 (Jocelyn's Meditite): Solo, crit Wing Attack, OHKO → L14
- Battle 2 (Lilith+Brenden double): Crit Machop, Combusken cleaned Meditite
- Battle 3 (Laura's Meditite): Solo, crit Wing Attack, OHKO → L15
- **4 straight wins. 2 level-ups. Ralts fainted the entire time.**

**The Story:** Taillow filled the void without being asked. No fanfare, just results. The backup became the closer became the ace — at least for this stretch.

**GM Action:**
- Rewarded Taillow +4 Atk EVs (slot 1)
- **Why:** Four battles of carrying while the lead was down. That's not luck — that's a role being claimed.

**Notes:**
- Combusken still largely benched (1 Peck in a double battle)
- Player trusting underdogs over the starter
- Ralts arc paused — waiting to see if player heals and re-leads with it
